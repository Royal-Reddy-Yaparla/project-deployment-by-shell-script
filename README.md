This project follows a 3-tier architecture, comprising web, app, and database layers.

For the frontend, we employed HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React JS to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.

In the backend, we utilized various programming languages including Java, Python, JavaScript (Node.js), and Golang, depending on the specific requirements of each component. This ensured flexibility and efficiency in handling diverse functionalities.

For the database layer, we incorporated MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ to manage and store data efficiently, providing scalability and reliability to the application.
